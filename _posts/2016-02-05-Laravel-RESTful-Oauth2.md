#Using Laravel to set up a RESTful Service with Oauth2 Server

> This tutorial is based on [Laravel 5 token based Authentication (OAuth 2.0)](https://medium.com/@mshanak/laravel-5-token-based-authentication-ae258c12cfea#.5bzflbkp9) & [Dingo Wiki](https://github.com/dingo/api/wiki).They both have some bugs and I fixed them.

##1.Install a new Laravel Project
```bash
composer global require "laravel/installer"
laravel new restful
```
